# kotogram-server

This is the backend for an educational pet project. To run it locally, use the command "npm run dev".

To obtain a library with all the requests, you can download Kotogram.postman_collection.json and import the collection into Postman [cmd + O].

In Postman, the base URL is set to localhost:3000 for working with the local server. If you need to retrieve data from a deployment, replace the base URL with https://koto.onrender.com/.
